# CONVENTIONS.md — Project Structure, Naming, and Code Standards

> The agent rewrites the **Project-specific overrides** section at the bottom during brief
> ingestion. Everything above it is the baseline standard and only changes when the brief
> demands it.

## Folder structure
All project-authored content lives under a single root to separate it from imported assets:

```
Assets/
  _Project/
    Art/                  (Models/, Materials/, Textures/, Animations/, Shaders/)
    Audio/                (Music/, SFX/, Mixers/)
    Prefabs/              (grouped by feature: Player/, Enemies/, UI/, Environment/ ...)
    Scenes/               (shipping scenes at root; Sandbox/ for test scenes)
    Scripts/
      Runtime/            (grouped by feature/domain, mirrors namespaces)
      Editor/             (custom inspectors, tooling; Setup/ for one-click wiring scripts)
      Tests/
        EditMode/
        PlayMode/
    Settings/             (ScriptableObject config assets, Input actions, render/quality)
    UI/                   (UXML/USS or sprite atlases, fonts)
  Plugins/                (third-party, only with approval)
```

- Empty folders are never committed; create folders only when first used.
- Nothing project-authored goes outside `_Project` except `Plugins/`.

## Assembly definitions
- `ProjectName.Runtime` on `Scripts/Runtime/`
- `ProjectName.Editor` on `Scripts/Editor/` (editor-only, references Runtime)
- `ProjectName.Tests.EditMode` / `ProjectName.Tests.PlayMode` on the test folders
- Keep `Auto Referenced` sensible; no cyclic references. Split further per-feature only if
  the project grows enough to justify it.

## Naming
| Thing | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| C# class / file | PascalCase, one public type per file | `EnemySpawner.cs` |
| Interface | `I` prefix | `IDamageable` |
| Namespace | `ProjectName.Feature`, mirrors folder | `CaseGame.Combat` |
| Private field | `_camelCase` | `_currentHealth` |
| Serialized private field | `[SerializeField] private` + camelCase | `[SerializeField] private float moveSpeed;` |
| Public property / method | PascalCase | `CurrentHealth`, `ApplyDamage()` |
| Constant / static readonly | PascalCase | `MaxEnemies` |
| Event | PascalCase, past/present intent | `HealthChanged`, `Died` |
| Scene | PascalCase noun | `Boot.unity`, `MainMenu.unity`, `Gameplay.unity` |
| Prefab | PascalCase; variants suffixed | `Enemy_Grunt.prefab`, `Enemy_Grunt_Elite.prefab` |
| ScriptableObject asset | Type-prefixed | `Config_PlayerMovement.asset`, `Wave_Level1.asset` |
| Input actions | `ProjectName.inputactions` | |
| Materials / textures | `M_`, `T_` prefixes | `M_Enemy_Grunt`, `T_Enemy_Grunt_Albedo` |

## Code standards
- **Humble MonoBehaviours.** MonoBehaviours handle Unity lifecycle, serialization, and
  scene references only; decision logic lives in plain C# classes injected or constructed
  by them, unit-testable without the engine.
- **Configuration in ScriptableObjects**, never hardcoded tuning values. Designers must be
  able to tune without code changes.
- **Decoupling:** communicate across systems via C# events, or ScriptableObject event
  channels when designer-facing wiring is valuable. No `GameObject.Find`, no string-based
  `SendMessage`, no cross-system singletons unless the brief mandates them. If a service
  locator or singleton is brief-mandated, isolate it behind an interface.
- **References:** assign via inspector or explicit initialization. `GetComponent` cached in
  `Awake`. `RequireComponent` where a dependency is structural.
- **Update discipline:** no per-frame allocations, no empty Unity messages, no polling that
  an event can replace. Pool anything spawned repeatedly.
- **Input:** Unity Input System (new), via generated C# wrapper or `PlayerInput`, per brief.
- **Async:** coroutines by default; `async/await`/UniTask only with approval or brief mandate.
- **Null checks on Unity objects** use implicit bool / `ReferenceEquals` correctly; never `?.`
  on UnityEngine.Object.
- Braces always, `var` only when the type is obvious, expression-bodied members for trivial
  accessors, XML doc comments on public APIs of non-obvious systems.

## Scene composition
- `Boot` scene (entry point, persistent systems) → loads content scenes additively or via
  transitions, unless the brief specifies a different flow.
- Scene hierarchy uses top-level organizer objects: `--- SYSTEMS ---`, `--- ENVIRONMENT ---`,
  `--- GAMEPLAY ---`, `--- UI ---`. No loose objects at root.
- Everything instantiated at runtime parents under a designated container.

## Version control hygiene
- `.gitignore` for Unity (Library, Temp, Logs, UserSettings, obj, .idea excluded).
- Visible meta files + force text serialization (assumed already set; flag if not).
- Commit per feature with imperative messages: `Add wave spawning system`.

## Project-specific overrides (rewritten per brief)

| Brief mandate | Baseline rule replaced | Brief section |
|---|---|---|
| **Singleton pattern is required** (at minimum for `GameManager`). Still isolate behind a minimal interface at call sites where practical, and don't let it sprawl into a general service locator. | "no cross-system singletons unless the brief mandates them" (Code standards → Decoupling) | DESIGN → Design Patterns |
| **MVC-style separation is required**, not just encouraged: Model = ScriptableObject definitions (`BuildingDefinition`, `UnitDefinition`) + plain C# state (`Health`, combat), View = rendering-only MonoBehaviours, Controller = input/event-wiring MonoBehaviours. | Reinforces existing "Humble MonoBehaviours" rule — no replacement, just made explicit and non-optional. | DESIGN → "UI and Logic should be separated... using techniques like MVC" |
| **Object pooling is required** for the Production Menu's infinite scroll view (pool the list-item views), and used for units/buildings given the <20 draw-call budget and frequent spawn/destroy. | Reinforces existing "pool anything spawned repeatedly" rule. | UX → "Infinite Scrollview — Object Pooling"; DESIGN → Object Pooling; GI-12 |
| **Pathfinding must be custom grid-based A\***, not Unity NavMesh/NavMesh2D. | N/A (baseline is silent on pathfinding) — but forecloses reaching for NavMesh as "best practice." | ALGORITHM → Pathfinding (A*) |
| Game Board is a **discrete grid** (cell occupancy, world↔cell conversion). **Cell size is a designer-editable value on a `GridDefinition` SO, not a fixed constant** — chosen once art is finalized. New folder: `Scripts/Runtime/Grid/`. | N/A — new module, not a baseline replacement. | Human-confirmed, reference UI mockup; corrected — cell size not fixed |
| **No resource/currency system** — do not add tuneable "cost" fields to production even though ScriptableObject-driven tuning is otherwise the baseline default for economy-like values. | Narrows "Configuration in ScriptableObjects, never hardcoded tuning values" — there is simply no tunable cost to configure. | GI-4 |
| **Building/unit UI and factories must stay data-driven and generic** — no hardcoded per-type switch/enum branches in Production Menu or Info Panel UI, even though only Barracks + Power Plant + 3 soldiers ship. | Sharpens the baseline "Configuration in ScriptableObjects" + SOLID (open/closed) rule into a hard requirement rather than a nice-to-have. | Human-confirmed extensibility requirement |
| Additional folders under `Scripts/Runtime/`: `Buildings/`, `Units/`, `Combat/`, `Pathfinding/`, `Placement/`, `Selection/`, `Pooling/`, `Events/`, `UI/Production/`, `UI/Info/`, `UI/MainMenu/`, `UI/Settings/`, `Gameplay/` (Report 017 — `GameplayBootstrap`, the Gameplay scene's composition root), `CameraControl/` (Report 019 — `CameraController`; named `CameraControl`, not `Camera`, to avoid a namespace/type collision with `UnityEngine.Camera`, see decisions log #51), `Environment/` (Report 032/040 — `IslandTileSet`/`IslandTilemapLayout`/`IslandTerrainView` generate the procedural island terrain for any grid size, `TerrainCompositor` bakes it into one SRP-batchable quad at gameplay-scene load; `BorderDecorationLayout` — Report 030's decorative-ring geometry — was removed as dead code once its one-off consumer script was gone, see ARCHITECTURE.md decisions log) — mirrors the module map in ARCHITECTURE.md §2. | Extends (does not replace) the baseline "grouped by feature/domain, mirrors namespaces" rule. | Derived from GI-1–19 and DESIGN section collectively |
| New `Art/Tiles/` folder (Report 030 — `Tile_Water.asset`) for `UnityEngine.Tilemaps.Tile` assets, alongside the existing `Art/Materials/`/`Art/Shaders/`. | Extends the baseline folder diagram's `Art/` subfolders — Tilemap assets didn't exist in the project before this report. | Derived, Report 030 (first Tilemap content in the project) |
| ScriptableObject asset naming for this project: `BuildingDef_<Name>.asset` (e.g. `BuildingDef_Barracks.asset`), `UnitDef_<Name>.asset` (e.g. `UnitDef_Soldier1.asset`) — more specific than the generic `Config_`/`Wave_` examples in the baseline table. | Specializes (does not replace) the baseline "Type-prefixed" SO naming rule. | GI-2, GI-9 |
| Scene flow is `Boot.unity` → `MainMenu.unity` → `Gameplay.unity` (Main Menu with Play + Settings screen is human-mandated). | N/A — baseline already lists `MainMenu.unity` as an example scene name; this confirms it's actually used, not just an example. | Human-mandated, requirement 19 |
| **Prefer typed asset-picker `SerializeField`s over raw string fields for asset references** (e.g. `SceneReference` instead of a scene-name string) — avoids typo-prone, rename-unsafe hardcoded names. Where Unity has no built-in typed reference for the asset kind (e.g. `SceneAsset` is Editor-only), wrap it: an editor-only asset field synced to a runtime-safe value via `ISerializationCallbackReceiver`, paired with a `CustomPropertyDrawer` so the Inspector still shows a single picker. | Sharpens "References: assign via inspector or explicit initialization" — this is the same principle, just closing the "raw string" loophole for asset-shaped references specifically. | Human-mandated (Report 004) |
| **ScriptableObject definition assets live under `Assets/_Project/ScriptableObjects/GameEntityDefs/<Category>/`** (e.g. `GameEntityDefs/Buildings/`, `GameEntityDefs/Units/` — renamed from an earlier `ScriptableObjects/Units/{Buildings,Troops}/` pass to match the `GameEntityDefinition` base class name), not the generic `Settings/` folder — `Settings/` is no longer used for these. | Replaces the baseline folder diagram's `Settings/` line for SO *definition* assets specifically (Input actions/render/quality settings, if any land later, would still be a separate concern). | Human-directed (hand-wiring adjustment after Reports 009/012) |
| **Building/unit prefabs are a parent GameObject with child GameObjects for each concern** — e.g. `Building_Barracks` has `Visuals` (SpriteRenderer), `Hitbox` (collider, for future selection/click-targeting), and `SpawnPoint` children; `Soldier_1`/`Soldier_2`/`Soldier_3` have `Visuals`/`Hitbox` — rather than one flat GameObject with every component on the root. Both follow the same `<Category>_<Name>` naming. Building prefabs live under `Prefabs/Buildings/`, soldier prefabs under `Prefabs/Units/`. As of Report 013, building prefabs also need a `VisualsGrayscale` child (SpriteRenderer, `M_SpriteGrayscaleGhost` material, same sprite as `Visuals`, inactive by default) for the Placement ghost preview. As of Report 022, all 5 entity prefabs (buildings and soldiers) also need an `Outline` child (SpriteRenderer, `M_SpriteSelectionOutline` material, same sprite as `Visuals`, sorting order one below it, disabled by default) wired to `GameEntityBase.outlineRenderer`, for selection feedback. | Extends (does not replace) the baseline scene-composition rule that "everything instantiated at runtime parents under a designated container" — applies the same per-prefab-instance grouping instinct one level down. | Human-directed (hand-wiring adjustment after Reports 009/012/013), extended Report 022 |
| **Shader files: PascalCase descriptive name, no prefix** (e.g. `SpriteGrayscaleGhost.shader`), under `Art/Shaders/` — the baseline naming table's `M_`/`T_` prefixes apply to Materials/textures, not shaders themselves. | New — the baseline table didn't previously cover shaders since none existed. | Derived, Report 013 (first shader in the project) |
| **UI prefabs live under `Prefabs/UI/`, plain PascalCase name, no `<Category>_` prefix** (e.g. `ProductionMenuItem.prefab`) — unlike Buildings/Units, a UI widget prefab typically has no family of same-category named siblings to disambiguate, so the prefix would be noise. **Root-level config/data ScriptableObject assets** (not `GameEntityDefinition` subclasses) use `<Type>_Default.asset` naming, alongside `GridDef_Default.asset` at `ScriptableObjects/` root — e.g. `BuildingCatalog_Default.asset`. As the number of these grew, they were further split into `ScriptableObjects/Catalogues/` (catalog/list assets) and `ScriptableObjects/Events/` (event-channel assets, e.g. `BuildingCatalogEntryEvent_Default.asset`, `BuildingRemovalRequestedEvent_Default.asset`) rather than left flat at root — this note supersedes the original "at root" wording below, which described an earlier, smaller state. `GameEntityDefs/<Category>/` stays reserved for actual entity definitions. | Extends the baseline "Type-prefixed" SO naming rule and the `<Category>_<Name>` prefab override with a case they didn't cover. | Derived, Report 014 (first UI prefab and first non-entity-def SO assets besides `GridDef_Default.asset`); subfoldered later as the count grew |
| **`Art/Sprites/UI/` folder** holds small UI-adjacent art not part of the main Tiny Swords "UI Elements" pack pull — currently TextMeshPro's `TMP_Dropdown` default sub-assets (`BottomTitle.png`, `Checkmark.png`, `DownChevron.png`, `TopTitle.png`), referenced by `SettingsPanel.prefab`/`MainPanel.prefab` and packed into `SpriteAtlas_UI.spriteatlas`. | Extends the baseline folder diagram's `Art/` subfolder list, which didn't anticipate TMP's own default widget art needing a project-local home. | Derived, Report 005 (first TMP_Dropdown in the project) |
| **Scene organizer convention, made explicit and uniform across all 3 scenes**: `--- SYSTEMS ---` holds `EventSystem` *and* every Controller MonoBehaviour (`PlacementController`, `SelectionController`, `UnitProductionController`, `GameplayBootstrap`, `CameraController`, `MainMenuController`, ...); `--- UI ---` holds only `Canvas` (and its content). `Main Camera` nests under `--- ENVIRONMENT ---` in scenes that have one (`Gameplay.unity`); `Boot.unity` has no camera at all, since `GameManager.Awake` loads `MainMenu.unity` before anything would ever need to render. Fixed post-audit, 2026-07-23 — `MainMenu.unity`/`Gameplay.unity` had drifted from each other (`EventSystem`/Controller placement swapped between the two), and both `Boot.unity`/`Gameplay.unity` had a loose root-level `Main Camera`. | Sharpens the baseline "top-level organizer objects... no loose objects at root" rule from a general principle into this project's one specific, uniform interpretation. | Human-directed audit fixup, 2026-07-23 |
